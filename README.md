1. What challenges did you face when refactoring your code to use Bootstrap?
I found it a bit tricky to match my original custom styles using Bootstrap’s predefined classes. It also took some time to understand which Bootstrap utilities replaced my existing CSS and how the grid system worked for layout adjustments.

2. How did using Bootstrap utility classes and components simplify your styling process?
Bootstrap made the styling process much faster. I didn’t need to write extra CSS for spacing, alignment, or layout. The built-in classes helped me keep the code cleaner and more consistent.

3. In what scenarios might you choose not to use Bootstrap and write custom CSS instead?
I would use custom CSS when I need a very unique design that Bootstrap can’t easily achieve or when I want full control over the layout and styles without depending on a framework.
